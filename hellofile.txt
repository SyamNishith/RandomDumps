Files:most of the time when we are working with data in programs we use variable to store data
which are not permanent storage in order to store data persistently we need the concept of databases but they are in the format of rows and columns which are
complex.soo best way to store is text files.
Modes of files:
open-"o"
read -"r"
write-"w"
append-"a"
if we use file with read mode we can only read file
if we want to write file then we have to open file using write mode.
if we say file with filename and write mode and if the file is not present it will create a new file with
the mentioned file name.  
'''f=open("file_handling1.txt","r")#to open the files
#print(f.read())#to read all the content
print(f.readline(),end="#")#to read line by line.
f1=open("syamnishith","
w")# if we dont have a file with filename it will create a new file.
f1.write("hello")#write is just to write data into file it will not save
f1=open("syamnishith","a")#append mode is used to add data to file
f1.write(" how are you")#we can copy data from one file to another file as well
for data in f:
    f1.write(data)'''
f2=open("REDBULL.jpg","rb")
'''print(f2.read())'''
f3=open("newphoto2.jpg","wb")
for i in f2:
    f3.write(i)
